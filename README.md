## Why?

Paid inbox cleaners exist, but they cost money and require handing over access to a third party. ScrubInbox runs entirely in your browser -- your Gmail data never touches a server. It uses the Gmail API to scan your inbox by sender domain and lets you bulk delete thousands of emails at once.

## How It Works

1. **Sign in** with Google to grant temporary, browser-only access
2. **Scan** your inbox -- emails are grouped by sender domain
3. **Review** domains, see email counts and sample subjects
4. **Preview** what will be deleted (dry-run mode)
5. **Delete** unwanted emails in bulk

Starred and labeled emails are automatically protected and won't appear in scan results.

### Why not exclude "Important" emails?

Gmail's `IMPORTANT` label is applied automatically by Google's priority inbox algorithm -- it is not an explicit user action. In practice, Gmail marks the vast majority of inbox threads as important, so excluding them would silently discard nearly all scan results. `STARRED`, by contrast, is always a deliberate user action, so starred threads are always excluded.

### Why client-side filtering?

Thread filtering (label exclusion, starred exclusion) is done client-side after fetching threads from the Gmail API rather than via Gmail query operators like `-label:Name`. We tested server-side filtering via the `threads.list` `q` parameter and found it is unreliable for real-world label names.

**The `-label:` operator silently fails for labels with spaces or slashes.** Gmail's query parser treats spaces as delimiters, so `-label:Work Projects` is parsed as `-label:Work` plus the search term `Projects` -- the exclusion is lost and results are unfiltered. Neither quoting (`-label:"Work Projects"`) nor hyphenating (`-label:Work-Projects`) fixes this. Nested labels with `/` like `Finance/Receipts` also fail the same way.

For simple single-word labels like `Newsletters`, `-label:Newsletters` works correctly. But since there's no way to know which labels in a user's account will work and which won't, we can't rely on it.

We verified this empirically against the Gmail API:

```
Label exclusion test: "Newsletters"      -- simple name
  label:Newsletters                         1    ← correct, 1 thread has this label
  -in:trash -in:spam -label:Newsletters   500    ← correct, excludes the 1 thread
  Consistency: 501 ≈ 1 + 500 = 501  ✓

Label exclusion test: "Work Projects"    -- spaces in name
  label:Work Projects                     501    ← WRONG, returns all threads
  -in:trash -in:spam -label:Work Projects 501    ← WRONG, excludes nothing
  Consistency: 501 ≈ 501 + 501 = 1002  ✗
```

Client-side filtering against the actual `labelIds` returned by `threads.get` is reliable and predictable regardless of label name format.

## Privacy & Security

- **100% client-side** -- all Gmail API calls go directly from your browser to Google
- **No backend** -- static site, no server to intercept your data
- **Token in memory only** -- expires after ~1 hour, never persisted
- **Open source** -- inspect every line of code

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A Google Cloud project with Gmail API enabled and an OAuth client ID ([setup guide](https://console.cloud.google.com/))

### Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID to .env

npm install
npm run dev
```

### Test & Build

```bash
